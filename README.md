# Python-Grading-Program
This grading program made in python has the objective to make grading activities in a class easier. Also, I am making this project to train some of abilities learned while studying python.

# Expanded Description
This project will begin with a big while loop that will allow the user to keep using the program or exiting the grading system

There will be options allowing the teacher to configure the grading system used in their class

Then the teacher will chose to add grades in certain sections, view information, and other actions
